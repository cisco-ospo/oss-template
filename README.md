## Before You Start

As much as possible, we have tried to provide enough tooling to get you up and
running quickly and with a minimum of effort. This includes sane defaults for
documentation; templates for bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests;
and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that will
automatically manage stale issues and pull requests. This latter defaults to
labeling issues and pull requests as stale after 60 days of inactivity, and
closing them after 7 additional days of inactivity. These
[defaults](.github/workflows/stale.yml) and more can be configured. For
configuration options, please consult the documentation for the [stale
action](https://github.com/actions/stale).

In trying to keep this template as generic and reusable as possible, there are
some things that were omitted out of necessity and others that need a little
tweaking. Before you begin developing in earnest, there are a few changes that
need to be made:

- [ ] âœ… Select an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) for
  your project. This can easily be achieved through the 'Add File' button on the
  GitHub UI, naming the file `LICENSE`, and selecting your desired license from
  the provided list.
- [ ] Update the `<License name>` placeholder in this file to reflect the name
  of the license you selected above.
- [ ] Replace `<INSERT_CONTACT_METHOD>` in
  [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) with a suitable communication
  channel.
- [ ] Change references to `org_name` to the name of the org your repository belongs
  to (eg. `cisco-open`):
  - [ ] In [`README.md`](README.md)
  - [ ] In [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Change references to `repo_name` to the name of your new repository:
  - [ ] In [`README.md`](README.md)
  - [ ] In [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Update the Release and Lint `README` badges to point to your project URL.
- [ ] Update the links to `CONTRIBUTING.md` to point to your project URL:
  - [ ] In
    [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)
  - [ ] In
    [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml)
  - [ ] In
    [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md)
- [ ] Update the `Affected Version` tags in
  [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)
  if applicable.
- [ ] Replace the `<project name>` placeholder with the name of your project:
  - [ ] In [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - [ ] In [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
- [ ] Add names and contact information for the project maintainers to
  [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md).
- [ ] Update the `<project-name>` placeholder in
  [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) as well as the
  `<maintainer-team-name>` and `<admin-team-name>` entries.
- [ ] Delete the release placeholder content in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
  We encourage you to [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
- [ ] Configure [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml) for your project's
  language and tooling dependencies.
- [ ] In [`.github/settings.yml`](.github/settings.yml), update the following fields:
  - [ ] `name`: Replace with the repository name for your project
  - [ ] `description`: A short, 1-2 sentence description of your project
  - [ ] `teams`: Uncomment and update the GitHub team names and permissions as appropriate
  - [ ] `branches`: Uncomment and enable branch protection settings for your
    project _(please **do not** disable branch protection entirely!)_
- [ ] Replace the generic content in this file with the relevant details about
  your project.
- [ ] ðŸš¨ Delete this section of the `README`!
